# C7_BrickGame_v1.0-1
implement the Tetris game in the C programming language using a structural approach.

## BrickGame

BrickGame is a popular handheld console from the 90s with several thousands of built-in games developed in China. Originally, it was a copy of Tetris, developed in the USSR and released by Nintendo as part of the GameBoy platform, but also included many other games that were added over time. The console had a small screen with a 10x20 size playing field, which was a matrix of "pixels". There was a scoreboard to the right of the field with a digital display of the current game status, records and other additional information. The most popular games on BrickGame were Tetris, Tanks, Racing, Frogger, and Snake.

## Intruduction

The project must consist of two parts for implementing the Tetris game: a library that implements the game's logic, which can be connected to various GUIs in the future, and a terminal interface. The logic of the library must be implemented using finite-state machines.
